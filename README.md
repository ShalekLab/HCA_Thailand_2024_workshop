## Workshop overview

Single-cell sequencing technologies are powerful tools used to assess genomic, transcriptomic and proteomics information at the single-cell level. In recent years, the application of techniques that use single-cell sequencing have become increasingly common in several areas of research: including medicine, agriculture, and other life sciences disciplines. Single-cell sequencing may be used to study many aspects of an organismâ€™s biology, both in health and disease, and the results of these studies contribute immensely to advancing the understanding of organisms as a whole. 

The establishment of collaborative scientific endeavors like the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) is a testament to the surging enthusiasm and curiosity in this domain. Yet, when we look towards Latin America, we find a gap in the necessary infrastructure, financial support, and subject matter expertise required to harness these cutting-edge technologies. Recognizing this, our workshop is designed to bridge this gap. We provide participants with hands-on experience in the laboratory and in-depth bioinformatics training, ensuring that the region advances in its capabilities with single-cell methodologies.
