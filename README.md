## Workshop overview

Single-cell sequencing technologies are powerful tools used to assess genomic, transcriptomic and proteomics information at the single-cell level. In recent years, the application of techniques that use single-cell sequencing have become increasingly common in several areas of research: including medicine, agriculture, and other life sciences disciplines. Single-cell sequencing may be used to study many aspects of an organism’s biology, both in health and disease, and the results of these studies contribute immensely to advancing the understanding of organisms as a whole. 

The establishment of collaborative scientific endeavors like the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) is a testament to the surging enthusiasm and curiosity in this domain. Yet, when we look towards Latin America, we find a gap in the necessary infrastructure, financial support, and subject matter expertise required to harness these cutting-edge technologies. Recognizing this, our workshop is designed to bridge this gap. We provide participants with hands-on experience in the laboratory and in-depth bioinformatics training, ensuring that the region advances in its capabilities with single-cell methodologies.

## Hands-On Bioinformatics Training Material

Below, you will find the links to the pre-course videos and Google Colab notebooks for the practical modules. 

### Practical Modules with Google Colab Notebooks:

Coming soon!
- [Notebook 01 - Processing raw scRNA-seq data](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ShalekLab/HCA_Thailand_2024_workshop/blob/main/notebooks/Notebook_A_Processing_RawSeqs_CellRanger.ipynb):
_Processing raw single-cell sequencing data (scRNA-seq) is a crucial step in the whole pipeline analysis of scRNA-Seq experiments. Depending on the library preparation method used, the RNA sequences will be acquired either from 3’ ends (or 5’ ends) of the transcripts (10X Genomics, CEL-seq2, Drop-seq, inDrops) or from full-length transcripts (Smart-seq). The choice of a specific method will depend entirely on the biological question and the downstream analysis to be implemented from a count matrix. In this notebook we will cover theoretical and practical steps in setting up from raw sequences (reads)to count matrix analysis pipelines, as well as explore the basic output of the Cell Ranger tool._
